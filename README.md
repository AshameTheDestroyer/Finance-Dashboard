# Finance-Dashboard

v1. The project is basically just a training of making my very first dashboard, I really look forward to see how it turns out ðŸ”¥.

v2. Done lots of work today, I've written the majority of the landing section content, it was so great to see the pie chart finally working as intended.

v5. Added all the animation stuff to the project, now's the porject's finished, (BTW I forgot to write all of v3, and v4, so don't mind me).
